# Overview

This repo contains example scripts to help a new developer get up and running quickly with local EEG streams and remote access to the Petal API.

Scripts are provided in a couple common languages for:

* streaming & receiving EEG data over LSL:
  * from a file
  * from random data
* making API calls to Petal APIs including:
  * preprocessing
  * bandpower

## Installation

See each respective language example sub-folder for a README on installation.

## Documentation
